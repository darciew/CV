## Darcie Walsh

Highly engaged and ambitious Junior Web Developer (in training!) looking to expand my knowledge on existing technologies and explore new ones in a collaborative team. I have a keen interest in AI and UX, particularly on how the two combine together in order to deliver more intuitive and transparent experiences.

After working for two tech companies since graduating university I became fascinated with the world of tech and realised I needed a career change out of my admin-based role. Completing online coding tutorials and attending industry meetups, I was hooked, and decided to pursue a career in web development.  

Joining Makers Academy in September 2018, the 16 week coding bootcamp will aim to further develop my programming skills, allow me to continue learning best practices and provide the opportunity to build some exciting projects (insert project link here). (update this throughout course)
