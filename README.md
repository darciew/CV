Highly engaged and ambitious Full Stack Web Developer looking to add value, expand my knowledge on existing technologies and explore new ones in a collaborative space. Excited to join a company where I can gain hands-on activity and be a visible member of the team.

After working for two tech start-ups since graduating university I became fascinated with the world of tech and realised I needed a career change out of my admin-based role. Finding online resources and attending industry meet-ups, I was hooked, and decided to pursue a career in web development.

Graduating from Makers Academy in November 2018, the 16 week coding bootcamp has taught me the importance of collaboration in an engineering environment. I love sharing knowledge and learnings with other passionate people in order to always keep growing and adapting, asking for feedback often to keep myself on track.
