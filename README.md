Highly engaged and ambitious Full Stack Web Developer looking to add value, expand my knowledge on existing technologies and explore new ones in a collaborative space. Excited to join a company where I can gain hands-on experience and be a visible member of the team.

After working for two tech start-ups since graduating university I became fascinated with the world of tech and realised I needed a career change out of my admin-based role. Finding online resources and attending industry meet-ups, I was hooked, and decided to pursue a career in web development.

Graduating from Makers Academy in November 2018, the 16 week coding bootcamp has taught me the importance of collaboration in an engineering environment. I love sharing knowledge and learnings with other passionate people in order to always keep growing and adapting, asking for feedback often to keep myself on track.

## :bulb: Skills

### Excellent Communicator

Proven ability to communicate effectively at all levels of a business.

- As an Office Manager of a busy start-up, communication was at the heart of my role. I reported directly to the CFO, COO, and VP of Engineering often having to brief them on my day-to-day tasks and key business updates.

- Weekly 1-2-1 meetings with C-level managers. Deciding what information was important and how to present it was essential, so I made sure to follow a structured agenda.

- Often presented in team meetings on topics such as office moves, social events and company wide updates.

- First point of contact for customers, clients, investors and other key stakeholders of the business.


### Problem Solving

Being an Office Manager meant constantly tackling problems and crafting their solutions.

- Partnered with HR to create and design an on-boarding process for new staff.

- Assisted organising an impromptu office move that required finding and moving to a new site within 2 months of notice. I diagrammed and presented different location options to evaluate the best solution.

- Worked closely with the VP of Engineering to develop IT solutions, I was the first point of call for any technical issues in the office. I created a database to keep track of company laptops through our security software system, something that wasn't in place when I began.

At Makers, I worked hard to approach problems methodically.

- During our final project at Makers, we were struggling to correctly test React Component's changing state. I took some time out to learn about React Native testing using Jest and Enzyme. After a bit of time researching I was able to write our first passing test and increase our overall test coverage.

### Self Starter Who Thrives in a Collaborative Environment

I work best when I am surrounded by a team of passionate, like-minded individuals.

- Experience working in an agile environment, taking part in stand-ups and leading retrospectives.

- Organised 'Tea Time Tuesdays' at Property Partner as part of a 'culture uplift' - a chance for everyone in the company to take a 10 minutes break over a nice cup of tea and check-in with each other.

### Mentoring

- Signed up to mentor students from newer cohorts and created a program to help improve my mentee's TDD skills. After pairing on the exercise he contacted me after to say it massively helped him improve his process and he was able to complete a piece of work that he was unable to do previous to our session.
